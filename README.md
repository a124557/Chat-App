# Chat-App

### Languages/Technologies

HTML/CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, Node.js, and Chakra UI.

This app serves as an online chatting platform where users can message each other either one-on-one, or in group chats.

This app is still in the early development stages and so is not fully functional as of yet.

### Building

To start the frontend, navigate to the 'frontend' directory in your terminal, and run 'npm run start'. If you receive an error regarding the app not being able to connect to another port (such as 4000), try running the backend server as well by navigating to the root directory in your terminal and typing 'npm run backend'.
