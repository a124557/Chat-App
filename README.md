# Chat-App

### Languages/Technologies

HTML/CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, Node.js, and Chakra UI.

This app serves as an online chatting platform where users can message each other either in one-on-one conversations, or group chats.

This app is still in the early development stages and so is not fully functional as of yet.

Features to be added:

1. One-to-one chatting
2. Group chatting
3. Ability to upload profile photo
4. Users can log in witht their own credentials

### Building

Note:
It may be possible to get the frontend, and parts of the backend running. However, due to the requirement of environment variables, this app will not be fully functional without this file. You may create your own env file with 'PORT', 'MONGO_URI', and 'JWT_SECRET' variables in order to get it running locally. You will also need to have set up a MongoDB database, and have the app properly configured to connect to your database.

To start the frontend, navigate to the 'frontend' directory in your terminal, and run 'npm run start'. If you receive an error regarding the app not being able to connect to another port (such as 4000), try running the backend server as well by navigating to the root directory in your terminal and typing 'npm run backend'. Navigate to the URL produced in the console after starting the frontend portion in order to access the application.
